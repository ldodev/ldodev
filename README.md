### About me

Hello! my name is Rafael, I have a degree in Philosophy and I am majoring in Information Systems. 

In ancient Greece, Athenian citizens gathered in the “agora”, a public space, where citizens had the opportunity to expose their ideas without being censored, because through the conflict with contradictory arguments, between thesis and antithesis, it emerged as a result the synthesis. 

The Socratic method consists of, at first, leading the interlocutor to doubt his own knowledge on a given subject. And in the second moment, the interlocutor envisions new concepts, encouraging him to think for himself.

### My Skills

I use Arch Linux as the operating system for my personal workspace, and for programming the Eclipse and Visual Studio Code IDEs. The programming languages I use are Java, Typescript and Python, using UML modeling. To publish my projects in a docker container, I use Oracle Cloud providers, AWS and Cloudflare.

I'm interested in backend development, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline, orchestration, observability,  data science, code and infrastructure security. Recently I'm taking an interest in the various types of artificial intelligence.
