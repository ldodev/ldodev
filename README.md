## My Profile:

##### Hello! my name is Rafael, I have a degree in Philosophy and I am majoring in Information Systems. 

##### In ancient Greece, Athenian citizens gathered in the “agora”, a public space, where citizens had the opportunity to expose their ideas without being censored, because through the conflict with contradictory arguments, between thesis and antithesis, it emerged as a result the synthesis.

##### The Socratic method consists of, at first, leading the interlocutor to doubt his own knowledge on a given subject. And in the second moment, the interlocutor envisions new concepts, encouraging him to think for himself.
