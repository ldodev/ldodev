<h2> About me </h2>

<p>Hello! my name is Rafael, I have a degree in Philosophy and I am majoring in Information Systems. 

In ancient Greece, Athenian citizens gathered in the “agora”, a public space, where citizens had the opportunity to expose their ideas without being censored, because through the conflict with contradictory arguments, between thesis and antithesis, it emerged as a result the synthesis. 

The Socratic method consists of, at first, leading the interlocutor to doubt his own knowledge on a given subject. And in the second moment, the interlocutor envisions new concepts, encouraging him to think for himself. </p>

<h2> My Skills</h2>

<p>
I use Arch Linux as the operating system for my personal workspace, and for programming the Eclipse and Visual Studio Code IDEs. The programming languages I use are Java, Typescript and Python, using UML modeling. To publish my projects in a docker container, I use Oracle Cloud providers, AWS and Cloudflare.

I'm interested in backend development, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline, orchestration, observability,  data science, code and infrastructure security. Recently I'm taking an interest in the various types of artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2> List of Things That I Use </h2>

The philosopher Socrates mentioned, "I only know that I know nothing", because knowledge is similar to a river, and when we limit that river, by saying that we know everything, it is that we know nothing. Knowledge is continuous, we are learning all the time until the end of our lives. About the things I use in my day to day, some of these programming languages, operating systems, servers, frameworks and others, I have a basic level and others an intermediate level, but I am always studying and perfecting my knowledge.
